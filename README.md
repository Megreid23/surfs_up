## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide additional data to the client for the weather statistics for the months of June and December.

## Results
* Becuase of the climate, there is very little difference between the two months of the year shown in the statistical report.
* December precipitation dips slightly colder on average, but nothing too significant, whereas in June there is little variation between the averages of the highs and lows.
* Even in December, the average max precipitation is 83 degrees, to June's average max of 85 degrees.

## Summary
In other words, by going just off the presented information regarding weather statistics at each extreme season of the year, there is very little difference between the two, leading to a reasonable conclusion that the success of the propsed business would be unlikely to be affected due solely to the propsed analysis, though with the lower average precipitation rates it would be tempting to believe the business would have more success in the winter months.

Two additional queries to make that could confirm or negate this hypothesis, would be to run another analysis for temperature statistics in those months and to analyze the increase or decrease in tourism for June and December as well.
